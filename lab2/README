A file transfer application using TCP sockets. The first 4 bytes (in network byte order) will contain the number of bytes in the file to follow. 
The next 20 bytes will contain the name of the file. The rest of the bytes in the TCP stream to follow will contain the data in the file.


server.c is for the server to recieve and store files 
client.c is for the client to send files. 

The program is compiled by "make". 
First start the sever by typing the command "./ftps <local-port>" to open the server. 
Then open another terminal and start the client with the command "./ftpc <remote-IP> <remote-port> <local-file-to-transfer>". 
The recieved files will be stored in a newly generated directory called "ftp".
